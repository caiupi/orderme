                Order me represents a web application based on CakePhp that organizes the orders placed by customers in the restaurant.<br>
                By using a device with a browser, connected to the web, the customer can read the menu without signing up on the application.<br>
                By logging in or creating an account, customers are able to check which tables are available and make a reservation.
                Next, it is possible to add the preferred dishes to the cart and press the order button. Once completed, the customer can make the payment and leave the table.<br>
                The user with admin role is able to see all the usersâ€™ reservations and orders and is also able to cancel an order.<br>
